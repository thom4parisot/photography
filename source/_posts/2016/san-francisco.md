      My first day in San Francisco was spent outside of it, in the *Sonoma Valley*: reuniting with old friends and parking our rusty bones for a dinner by the water.

      I would then discover *San Fran*, by crossing the Golden Gate Bridge by night and by not seeing anything but its lights.

      I see lines everywhere, and signs. Way more astringent than in United Kingdom. *Behave*.

      Reading and writing a few notes. Are the other readers fellows from the city or are they tourists as well?

      When was the last time you waited on the pavement for 10 good minutes?
      People look at you with a bit of curiosity. Nobody waits on a crossing isle for good lighting conditions.

      I remember tourists taking selfies in front of the cathedral while I was turning my back to them, to snap another kind of edifice.

      They even aligned the *Sutro Tower* with the main road.

      It is strange seeing people waiting indeed. Unless they are playing to
      Pokémon GO…

      This photography prevents you to endure the strong wind with your entire body.

      This viewpoint reminds me a scene from [Planet of the Apes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes).

      What I do not know is less than a mile away, the coastal path is sunny enough to be sunburnt.

      As soon as you reach the top of Berkeley Hills, a whole new landscape awaits: dry grass, (artificial) lakes and no urbanity at all.

      Behind me, the landscape is crippled with buildings, piped together with bridges.

I loved *San Francisco* and it has been a big surprise to me: it is like London by the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean), more hilly and  enjoyable by foot, bike or bus.
