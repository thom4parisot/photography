      A few minutes after 7am, Friday 21<sup>st</sup> October 2016.

      We are excited to cross the Channel to reach out our native country. Although we _do not know what to expect_ when we arrive at the camps.

      We are the **last car to make it to the ferry**: they closed the boarding ramp right after we turned the engine off.

      We befriend with Jamie as he is sharing the ride as well.

      He is taking a few weeks off to volunteer at Dunkirk refugees camp. He went there earlier this year but was not prepared for the harsh winter conditions.

      This time he _feels ready_.

      We randomly discover that our ferry is *actually* heading to Dunkirk instead of Calais.

      We decide to **change our plans** and to _follow_ Jamie to the Dunkirk refugees camp. We would then go to Calais tomorrow, with some more experience, knowledge and outlook.

      The ride is now over and we are soon to walk in an unknown place to us.

      We smile at the cops. They seemed relaxed and easy to talk to.

      Maybe it is easy because we are *not* refugees.

      Someone asks for our passports at the entrance of the camp. They are eager to know for which NGO we work with. Jamies knows. We follow.

      In a few meters, we are going to become the *strangers*.

      There are only a pair of NGOs left in the camp. The others left *in protest*.

      Petra depicts us the situation. She refers to the [Kesha Niya Kitchen](http://keshaniya.org/) : at some point, refugees would claim food and be told there is a shortage. They would humbly reply *Kesha Niya* in Kurdish, which means *no problem*.

      This World War II wood-powered portable kitchen is still operational.

      And handy as it _does not break_ and as wood is the _only cheap energy source_ around.

      Local authorities built and opened this information center inside the camp. They lately realised no one could speak in kurdish.
      The center remains closed since.

      Wood planks are missing because they have been taken out and used as heating source during the harsh winter.

      Numbers are to been seen on each shelter.

      There is _no_ registry so the shelter occupation level is one of the only way to know how crowded the camp is.

      Children were having so much fun it was difficult to hear each other.

      Kids were super proud to show their toys and to say _bonjour_ to us. Receiving a response increased the size of the smile on their face.

      A year ago, there was nothing except dirt at this very precise location.

      Now, the school is a central point of socialisation for kids and parents. It is a key element for a future integration in a _normal life_.

      It was Neil's last day at the camp. He used to teach French and English at the library.

      The library is a _central place_ where people get to _know_ about another language, like French or English, which proves to be key to fill in asylum requests.

      This is the food warehouse. Meals are provided twice a day, for more than 800 persons, managed by only one volunteer.

      Refugees and volunteers cook hand in hand, with music playing out loud.

      Refugees hated the food until some of them — who used to be chefs in Iraq — offered their help to cook and to match people habits. It has been a _huge success_.

      I feel good to have helped prepare the salad for dinner.

      The biggest danger for volunteers is to burn themselves in the process, working too much, thinking about it too much.

      They are responsible for the well-being of the camp inhabitants, and very few people take care of them.

      I want to say them a **big thank you**, for all the work, passion and efforts brought into something which looks like an endless battle.

      _You certainly changed_ the life of a bunch.

      It is dusk, and time to make our way to Calais. We hitchhike and get a ride with a lorry driver. We get to know a different opinion about the camp, the refugees and the violent incidents reported by journalists in the news. He mostly _understands_ and just want his lorry not to be damaged.

      We are soon due to arrive. Calais is wrapped in darkness, delimited by a corridor of white fences and the blue flashes of police cars rotating beacons. We can clearly feel the _tension_.

      We knew we were close to the _jungle_ as we saw these fences.

      Quiet, standing, still. I wonder _who_ is trapped, on which side.

      The _jungle_ is about to be demolished in a few days. The entire place feels empty on this Saturday morning.

      Nonetheless, I feel this rainbow to be providential, showing up over two churches: one of concrete, one of faith.

      Volunteers continue to provide school tuitions as long as they can. Tomorrow will probably be their _last day_.

      I felt more fatigue on their faces.
      They were already _out of_ the place.

      I love how much effort is put into making the fortune shelters more lively and visually appealing.

      It speaks out so much _hope_ and _dignity_.

      A longchair, an umbrella and a kitchen garden.

      Some people managed to make it a rather _singular_ place to live.

      Journalists get cautiously inspected by the police force.

      Some of them reported to us spending days in jail in atrocious conditions.

      These people were so happy to say _bonjour_ to us.

      They probably felt being close to the end of their journey. They would soon being able to reach the UK — a place depicted as a _the_ location to go to start a new life.

      I realise we went back and forth.

      We did in a day what most people in the camps have tried to do over months and even years for some — crossing the Channel.

      I am glad we helped, even only for a day.

I felt it became necessary to go beyond the _mass media_ depiction of the Calais refugees camp. So my friend [Basile](https://basilesimon.fr) and I packed our bags and booked a carpooling.
